    Initializes the default distributed process group, and this will also
    initialize the distributed package.

    There are 2 main ways to initialize a process group:
        1. Specify ``store``, ``rank``, and ``world_size`` explicitly.
        2. Specify ``init_method`` (a URL string) which indicates where/how
           to discover peers. Optionally specify ``rank`` and ``world_size``,
           or encode all required parameters in the URL and omit them.
        If neither is specified, ``init_method`` is assumed to be "env://".


    Arguments:
        init_method (str, optional): URL specifying how to initialize the
                                     process group. Default is "env://" if no
                                     ``init_method`` or ``store`` is specified.
                                     Mutually exclusive with ``store``.
        world_size (int, optional): Number of processes participating in
                                    the job. Required if ``store`` is specified.
        rank (int, optional): Rank of the current process.
                              Required if ``store`` is specified.
        store(Store, optional): Key/value store accessible to all workers, used
                                to exchange connection/address information.
                                Mutually exclusive with ``init_method``.
