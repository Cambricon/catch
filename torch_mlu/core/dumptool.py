    Dump imformations about CNNL Kernels.

    Arguments:
        enable (bool): Turn on/off the cnnl gencase API.
        level (str): Three mode that cnnl API provide,
            'L1' : dump shapes, dtype, layout and args of CNNL kernels to files.
            'L2' : dump shapes, dtype, layout, args and input real data of CNNL Kernels to files,
                   will take a long time.
            'L3' : print shapes, dtype layout and args of CNNL Kernels to screen.

    Return :
         The cnnl gencase API state(on/off).
